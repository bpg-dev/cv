       qualification from weeks to days (Terraform, Packer, vSphere / AWS EC2, Golang).
      - Performed maintenance tasks, performance improvements and optimizations in the current backend stack, which allowed
       continuous growth of the client base. Actively participated in DevOps rotation, improving and adapting operation procedures to
